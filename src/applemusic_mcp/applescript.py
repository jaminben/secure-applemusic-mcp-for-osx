"""AppleScript integration for Music.app on macOS.

This module provides direct control of the Music app via AppleScript,
enabling capabilities not available through the REST API like playback
control, deleting tracks from playlists, and deleting playlists.

Only available on macOS with the Music app installed.

Security Notes:
    - All user input (track names, playlist names, etc.) is escaped via
      _escape_for_applescript() which escapes backslashes first, then quotes,
      before embedding in AppleScript strings. This prevents injection attacks.
    - Scripts are executed via subprocess.run() with capture_output=True
      and a 30-second timeout to prevent hangs.
    - The osascript binary location is verified via shutil.which() before use.
