# Apple Music Integration

Guide for integrating with Apple Music. Three approaches: AppleScript (direct control), UI automation (catalog without API), and MusicKit API (cross-platform).

## When to Use

Invoke when users ask to:
- Manage playlists (create, add/remove tracks, list)
- Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume)
- Play an Apple Music URL (album, playlist, or song)
- Search catalog or library
- Add songs to library
- Access listening history or recommendations

## Critical Rule: Library-First Workflow

**You CANNOT add catalog songs directly to playlists.**

Songs must be in the user's library first:
- ❌ Catalog ID → Playlist (fails)
- ✅ Catalog ID → Library → Playlist (works)

**Why:** Playlists use library IDs (`i.abc123`), not catalog IDs (`1234567890`).

This applies to both AppleScript and API approaches.

---

# AppleScript (macOS)

Zero setup. Works immediately with the Music app.

**Run via Bash:**
```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to playpause'
osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to return name of current track'
```

**Multi-line scripts:**
```bash
osascript <<'EOF'
tell application "Music"
    set t to current track
    return {name of t, artist of t}
end tell
EOF
```

## Available Operations

| Category | Operations |
|----------|------------|
| **Playback** | play, pause, stop, resume, next track, previous track, fast forward, rewind, play URL |
| **Player State** | player position, player state, sound volume, mute, shuffle enabled/mode, song repeat |
| **Current Track** | name, artist, album, duration, time, rating, loved, disliked, genre, year, track number |
| **Library** | search, list tracks, get track properties, set ratings |
| **Playlists** | list, create, delete, rename, add tracks, remove tracks, get tracks |
| **AirPlay** | list devices, select device, current device |

    -- Recently played (sort by played date)
    tracks of library playlist 1 whose played date > (current date) - 7 * days
end tell
```

## Playlist Operations

```applescript
tell application "Music"
    -- List all playlists
    name of every user playlist

    -- Get playlist
    user playlist "Road Trip"
    first user playlist whose name contains "Road"

    -- Create playlist
    make new user playlist with properties {name:"New Playlist", description:"My playlist"}

    -- Delete playlist
    delete user playlist "Old Playlist"

    -- Rename playlist
    set name of user playlist "Old Name" to "New Name"

    -- Get playlist tracks
    every track of user playlist "Road Trip"
    name of every track of user playlist "Road Trip"

    -- Add track to playlist (must be library track)
    set targetPlaylist to user playlist "Road Trip"
    set targetTrack to first track of library playlist 1 whose name contains "Hey Jude"
    duplicate targetTrack to targetPlaylist

    -- Remove track from playlist
    delete (first track of user playlist "Road Trip" whose name contains "Hey Jude")

    -- Playlist properties

    set current AirPlay devices to {AirPlay device "Living Room"}

    -- Multiple devices
    set current AirPlay devices to {AirPlay device "Living Room", AirPlay device "Kitchen"}

    -- Device properties
    set d to AirPlay device "Living Room"
    name of d
    kind of d           -- computer, AirPort Express, Apple TV, AirPlay device, Bluetooth device
    active of d         -- true if playing
    available of d      -- true if reachable
    selected of d       -- true if in current devices
    sound volume of d   -- 0-100
end tell
```

## String Escaping

Always escape user input:
```python
def escape_applescript(s):
    return s.replace('\\', '\\\\').replace('"', '\\"')

safe_name = escape_applescript(user_input)
script = f'tell application "Music" to play user playlist "{safe_name}"'
```

## Limitations

- **macOS only** — no Windows/Linux
- **UI features require display** — UI automation won't work headless or with Music.app minimized

---

# UI Automation (macOS)

For catalog features without an API token. Controls Music.app through System Events (Accessibility API) and CoreGraphics (mouse events).

**Requirements:** Display attached, Music.app visible, Accessibility permissions for System Events (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).

## Key Concepts

**System Events** reads and clicks UI elements by their accessibility hierarchy:
```applescript
tell application "System Events" to tell process "Music"
    -- Main content area
    scroll area 2 of splitter group 1 of window "Music"
    -- Search field
    text field 1 of UI element 1 of row 1 of outline 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of window "Music"
end tell
```

**CoreGraphics mouse events** (via JXA) trigger hover effects that reveal hidden UI controls:
```javascript
// osascript -l JavaScript
ObjC.import("CoreGraphics");
var point = $.CGPointMake(x, y);
var event = $.CGEventCreateMouseEvent($(), $.kCGEventMouseMoved, point, 0);
$.CGEventPost($.kCGHIDEventTap, event);
```

## The Hover Trick

Music.app hides per-track Play and "Add to Library" buttons until the mouse hovers over a track row. To interact with them programmatically:

1. Find the track's UI element position via System Events
2. Move the mouse there via CoreGraphics (generates real hover events)
3. The hidden `checkbox` (play) and `button` (Add to Library) appear in the accessibility tree
4. Click them via System Events

## Search via UI

1. Set the search field value: `set value of searchField to "query"`
2. Press Return: `key code 36`
3. Wait for results to load (~4 seconds)
4. Parse the "Top Results" list from `scroll area 2`
5. Each result is a `UI element` with `description` = name, static texts for type/artist

**Note:** The type separator in results uses Unicode three-per-em space (U+2004) + middle dot (U+00B7): `Song꘎·꘎Radiohead`

## Window Recovery

Music.app can run without a window. To ensure a window exists:
```applescript
tell application "Music" to activate
tell application "System Events" to tell process "Music"
    if (count of windows) is 0 then
        click menu item "Music" of menu "Window" of menu bar 1
    end if
end tell
```

## Fragility

UI paths break when Apple updates Music.app's layout. Centralize paths as constants and test after macOS updates. Use Accessibility Inspector.app to explore the current hierarchy.

# MusicKit API

Cross-platform but requires Apple Developer account ($99/year) and token setup.

## Authentication

**Requirements:**
1. Apple Developer account
2. MusicKit key (.p8 file) from [developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list)
3. Developer token (JWT, 180 day max)
4. User music token (browser OAuth)

**Generate developer token:**
```python
import jwt, datetime

with open('AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8') as f:
    private_key = f.read()

token = jwt.encode(
    {
        'iss': 'TEAM_ID',
        'iat': int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()),
        'exp': int((datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=180)).timestamp())
    },
    private_key,
    algorithm='ES256',
    headers={'alg': 'ES256', 'kid': 'KEY_ID'}
)
```

**Get user token:** Browser OAuth to `https://authorize.music.apple.com/woa`

**Headers for all requests:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {developer_token}
Music-User-Token: {user_music_token}
```

**Base URL:** `https://api.music.apple.com/v1`

        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Library-First Workflow (Complete)

Adding a catalog song to a playlist requires 4 API calls:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {dev_token}",
    "Music-User-Token": user_token
}

# 1. Search catalog
r = requests.get(
    "https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={"term": "Wonderwall Oasis", "types": "songs", "limit": 1}
)
catalog_id = r.json()['results']['songs']['data'][0]['id']

# 2. Add to library
requests.post(
    "https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library",
    headers=headers,
    params={"ids[songs]": catalog_id}
)

# 3. Get library ID (catalog ID → library ID)
r = requests.get(
    f"https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/songs/{catalog_id}/library",
    headers=headers
)
library_id = r.json()['data'][0]['id']

# 4. Add to playlist (library IDs only!)
requests.post(
    f"https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library/playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks",
    headers={**headers, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"data": [{"id": library_id, "type": "library-songs"}]}
)
```

## Create Playlist

```bash
POST /v1/me/library/playlists
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "attributes": {
    "name": "Road Trip",
    "description": "Summer vibes"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "tracks": {
      "data": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Ratings

```bash
# Love a song (value: 1 = love, -1 = dislike)
PUT /v1/me/ratings/songs/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{"attributes": {"value": 1}}
```

## Limitations

- **No playback control** - API cannot play/pause/skip
- **Playlist editing** - can only modify API-created playlists
- **Token management** - dev tokens expire every 180 days
- **Rate limits** - Apple enforces request limits

---

# Common Mistakes

**❌ Using catalog IDs in playlists:**
```python
# WRONG
json={"data": [{"id": "1234567890", "type": "songs"}]}
```
**Fix:** Add to library first, get library ID, then add.

**❌ Playing catalog songs via AppleScript:**
```applescript
# WRONG
play track id "1234567890"
```
**Fix:** Song must be in library.

**❌ Unescaped AppleScript strings:**
```python
# WRONG
name = "Rock 'n Roll"
script = f'tell application "Music" to play playlist "{name}"'
```
**Fix:** Escape quotes.

**❌ Expired tokens:**
Dev tokens last 180 days max.
**Fix:** Check expiration, handle 401 errors.

# The Easy Way: mcp-applemusic

The [mcp-applemusic](https://github.com/epheterson/mcp-applemusic) MCP server handles all this complexity automatically: AppleScript escaping, token management, library-first workflow, ID conversions.

**Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/epheterson/mcp-applemusic.git
cd mcp-applemusic && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**Configure Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Apple Music": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-applemusic/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "applemusic_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On macOS, most features work immediately. For catalog features or Windows/Linux, see the repo README.

| Manual | mcp-applemusic |
|--------|----------------|
| 4 API calls to add song | `playlist(action="add", auto_search=True)` |
| Copy URL + open in Music | `playback(action="play", url="...")` |
| UI hover + click to add to library | `library(action="add")` with UI fallback |
| Track library changes manually | `library(action="snapshot")` |
| AppleScript escaping | Automatic |
| Token management | Automatic with warnings |
